Hi, I'm Matheus Willian. 

I like to read a lot of mangas, getting into novels now. I also love to cook, watch some series/animes with my girlfriend and play videogames.

I recently graduated in Computer Science at UFFRJ ( Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro ).

I'm studying some python, sql and power bi at the moment, trying to get into Data Analysis. But due to my graduation, I already do have some great base at programming logic so it's been on the easy way to get to know python compared to learn C. Since I did my internship at TIM Brasil and most of my work there was some kind of mix of management and Data Analysis, I have some strong knowledge at Excel, intermediary at Power Bi and good communication ( Had to exchange a lot of e-mails and participate in meetings with employees from TIM and outside ).

I did graduate at an English Course ( Wise Up!) on my early days. So I try my best to keep it in check. I consider myself to be at an advanced level.

Thanks for reading till here. If you're looking for a Junior at Data Analysis, feel free to contact me.
